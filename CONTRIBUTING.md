Creating a clear and comprehensive **contribution guide** is essential for encouraging contributions to your GitHub project. Below is an outline of key sections and best practices for crafting a good CONTRIBUTING.md file:

---

## **How to Contribute**

1. **Understand the Project**  
   - Read the [README](./README.md) to understand the project goals, structure, and how it works.
   - Check the [documentation](#link-to-docs) for further details.

2. **Reporting Issues**  
   - Search the [Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) to ensure your problem or suggestion hasn’t already been addressed.
   - Provide clear and concise descriptions:
     - Steps to reproduce (for bugs).
     - Expected and actual outcomes.
     - Suggested improvements (for feature requests).

3. **Suggesting Features**  
   - Open a [Feature Request Issue](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/new/choose) with a detailed description and use cases.

4. **Write Clean Code**
